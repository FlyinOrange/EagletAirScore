airScore
~~~~~~~~~

A bunch of scripts and php pages to handle IGC files and
store them into a mysql database, determine track distance, 
do paragliding RACE scoring, OLC-style scoring, etc. Also 
presents tracks on Google Maps for further viewing.

The basic philosophy is to provide the scoring
tools as a set of simple executable (perl scripts)
that can be wrapped with any GUI. At this stage
I've only provided a basic PHP/Google Maps 
interface. 

The database schema maybe found in xcdb.sql.
