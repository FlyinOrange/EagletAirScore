Learn to accurately assess the information ahead: shadow, wind, birds, sun, dust,
grass, smoke, dams, cloud formation locations, cloud shape, cloud drift and
terrain shapes.
% 
Understand the components of 'fast' flying.
%
Practice flying XC at faster than 'best-glide'.
%

Contribute and benefit from the gaggle.
%
Flying a competitive glider.
%
Thermals come from any surface that is readily heated by the sun.
%
Never stop observing clouds when working, driving, walking. Know the life-cycle of clouds.
%
If the gap between two clouds in a street is greater than the distance to the next parallel street it is probably wise to change streets.
%
If your bearing is at an angle to the cloud street it pays to go as far as possible along the streets and change street when a gap in your current street appears.
%
Use the first thermal(s) of the day to determine where the strongest and weakest climbs are within the thermal.
%
By avoiding slow climbs and getting stuck at inversions you fly faster and cover more ground.
%
Fly convergence when high, when leaving be aware of strong sink, when low be aware of strong turbulence.
%
On some days a strong thermal make take some time to push through the inversion, it may be worth waiting for.
