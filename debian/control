Description: airScore is a package for scoring different type of paragliding competitions, including open distance, open distance through turnpoints, and GAP and RACE scoring. The aims are: a) to reduce the scoring burden on competition organisers and place the uploading duties upon the competitors and b) provide a platform independent mechanism for scoring paragliding and hang gliding competitions.

Tracklogs maybe uploaded and scored via a web interface. Tracks and maps are managed with the assistance of google maps. The code is a collection of Perl and PHP scripts which do track verification and task scoring. It uses mysql in the background to store tracklogs, pilot details and competition details.
