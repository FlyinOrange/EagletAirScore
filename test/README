Regression Testing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Place holder for what I want to do:

1. Create the database / install in a testing directory/db.

2. CGI requests (using Perl CGI module) to:
    . create competition
    . create task 
    . submit known track logs
    . score
    . validate results against known results

    Variations on this for:
        . task types
        . different GAP configurations
        . valid/invalid tracks
        . airspace checking
        . leadout
        . etc


3. Report PASS/FAIL for each test
