Registration.

who will post your intentions to Topica.  Other pilots must be
given the opportunity to fly in the same conditions!
You may not fly alone.

Scoring 

http://skyhighparagliding.org/skyhighcup.htm
Submitted tracklogs will be scored using an OLC sytle scoring system.
Each tracklog with be optimised to include start, 3 waypoints and end points.
Tracks where the landing point is near the starting point may
gain bonus points based upon the area they enclose providing the
track form a simple polygon. Your track will be viewable on the web,
and you will be able to view other participants tracks.

Team flying - To encourage team flying should there be a bonus points if
pilots complete some of the flight with other pilots. On slow days I
suspect this could be very useful. On faster days gun pilots may have to
juggle gaggle points or loner speed.

Downloads must be within two weeks of the flight or at a club meeting if
you don't have your own cable. At the moment only .IGC files are 
accepted for scoring.

Safety Stuff.

Pilots must have a workable UHF. 
Any pilot tracklog submitted by a pilot flying without a radio 
will be considered to be invalid.
Safe flying condition.
If more than 50% of pilots present at a site see the conditions as un-flyable 
then the day will be considered to be invalid.
If there is a valid day, pilots do not have to launch if
they judge it invalid. If a pilot judges it valid and does not launch,
there vote is consider to be for an invalid day.

We encourage pilots at a site to fill out a <a href="">running sheet</a>
on the day with mobile phone numbers and appoint a duty pilotas per the
HGFA handbook.
